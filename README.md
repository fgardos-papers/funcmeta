**Functional meta-analysis for genomic studies**. 

Functional enrichment analysis of genomic data provides results that are part of the assessed experiment. However, the small sample size of most of the experiments and its marking to a specific scenario, represent limiting factors when evaluating such studies. Therefore, to improve the integration of various experiments in the functional context and provide clarity in the
interpretation,  we present a meta-analysis method to detect functional results of global interest, reducing the effect of
specific experiment. 

This methodology also checks the consistency of the experiments and generates an estimate of the effect having a greater statistical power than that obtained for each experiment separately.

This approach allows us a better interpretation of the analysis of genomic data in the context of Systems Biology.
